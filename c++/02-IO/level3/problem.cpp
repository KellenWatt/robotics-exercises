/*
 * Write a full program that acts as a greeting program.
 *
 * Whenever you run the program, it should prompt the user to enter a name by 
 * printing a message to the screen. Then you need to take in a name and print 
 * the string "Hi, <input name>! Welcome to the party!".
 *
 * For example, if the user types "Alex" as their name, then your program should
 * print "Hi, Alex! Welcome to the party!".
