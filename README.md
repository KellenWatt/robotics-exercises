# robotics-exercises
Exercises to accompany my robotics-lessons repository. Separate repository for easier student access.

Exercises will be split into sections, with the lessons covered by the exercises listed in the folder's README.

To complete these exercises, fork this repository, then solve the problems in your own repository.


Currently only contains C++ exercises, but will be split into langauge folders to organize later.
